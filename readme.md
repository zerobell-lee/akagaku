# Akagaku

Akagaku is an open-source project inspired by **Ukagaka (‰º∫„Åã)**, a popular Japanese desktop character program.  
This project aims to bring a similar interactive character experience to modern desktops, powered by **LangChain** and **LangGraph** for natural language processing and dynamic interactions.

## üî∞ Project Overview

Akagaku is an open-source desktop application inspired by **Ukagaka (‰º∫„Åã)**. Ukagaka is a desktop accessory software that enables users to interact with characters in a unique way.  
Akagaku brings this concept to life with modern technologies like **LangChain** and **LangGraph**, providing users with an enhanced and immersive experience where characters react dynamically to user inputs.

The project goes beyond simple desktop backgrounds by offering a system where characters have distinct personalities and backgrounds, allowing for deep interactions. The characters evolve and respond based on user behavior, creating an immersive, role-playing experience.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Character Interaction**: Characters observe and react to user activities in real time. Each character has a unique personality and background, with interactions changing based on user actions.
- **LangChain-Based Natural Language Processing**: Utilize advanced language models like OpenAI and Anthropic to provide human-like conversations with characters.
- **Multiple Character Selection**: Initially, the application offers a single character, but later updates will introduce multiple characters to interact with.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Users can customize character responses through prompt overrides, model selection, and tool management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Nextron**: The core framework combining **Next.js** with **Electron** to build the desktop application. This allows seamless integration between server-side rendering with Next.js and the native desktop application features provided by Electron.
- **Electron**: Framework for building cross-platform desktop applications.
- **Next.js (TypeScript)**: Framework for building the UI and API server.
- **LangChain**: A framework for connecting natural language processing and conversational AI models.
- **LangGraph**: A flow system extension of LangChain to build node-based dynamic conversations.
